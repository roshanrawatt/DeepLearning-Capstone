# Siamese Network

A Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture that consists of two or more identical sub-networks that share weights. Siamese networks are typically used for tasks that involve comparing two or more inputs and determining their similarity or dissimilarity.

One common application of Siamese networks is in the field of computer vision, where they can be used to compare images and determine whether they are of the same object or not. For example, a Siamese network might be trained to take two images of faces as input, and output a prediction of whether the two faces are of the same person or not.

Siamese networks can also be used for other types of comparison tasks, such as comparing text documents or audio recordings. The key feature of Siamese networks is that they are able to compare two inputs and make a prediction based on their relationship, rather than making a prediction for each input independently.
